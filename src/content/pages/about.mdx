At Hushify we are building open source, end-to-end encrypted ecosystem of tools and services that helps you protect your privacy.

We envision a digital world where privacy is paramount. A world free from invasive tracking, data breaches, and corporate data exploitation. We believe that everyone has the right to secure and private access to their digital assets.

Hushify Drive, our secure cloud storage solution, embodies our commitment to open source and user privacy. By offering end-to-end encryption and putting the power of privacy in the hands of users, we aim to create a more secure and private digital landscape for everyone.
